            The most amazing thing happened in the last few years. I began on a journey of learning not realizing that I would be putting these skills to use. I changed positions from a teacher to a digital learning coach. While coaching, I would encourage teachers to teach code to students during CS week. If they had no knowledge of it, I would teach the a lesson on code. I became interested myself, so I started at the beginning and learned HTML and CSS. That was about as far as I got when a few years later I was offered a job in a new postion as a digital media engineer. I would learn on the job and they offered to pay for classes to learn it thoroughly. So here I am, doing what I had been doing on the side for fun, now a my main job.
